# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim: To Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## Algorithm:

a. Apply Gestalt principles to enhance mobile and web layout design.

b. Incorporate UI elements and design patterns into the layouts.

c. Develop interaction behaviors and usability principles for the designs.

d. Create a brand logo using Canva, following styling and branding guidelines and include it with your layouts. 

## Output:

## a. Gestalt Principles in Layout

• Proximity: Group food image, name, price, and button together in one card.

• Similarity: Use the same color and shape for all action buttons.

• Continuity: Smooth flow from header → search → categories → items → cart.

• Figure/Ground: Highlight buttons in bold colors against a light background.

## b. UI Elements & Design Patterns

• Search Bar for quick discovery.

• Category Chips for easy filtering.

• Card-Based Layout for food items.

• Navigation Bars: Top navigation on web, bottom navigation on mobile.

• Grid Layout for web, scroll list for mobile.

## c. Interaction & Usability

• Feedback: Buttons change color on click; cart updates instantly.

• Consistency: Same icons and CTAs across pages.

• Accessibility: Clear fonts, large tap areas, focus states.

• Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both web and mobile.

## d. Brand Logo with Canva

• Create a simple, modern logo with your brand name (e.g., Foodify).

• Use a consistent color palette (e.g., red-orange for energy).

• Export in SVG/PNG and place in header, footer, and app icon.
